I think this is right??? This is tough!

The following code is an attempt at mocking up the pseudo code for the blue print algorithm found in Pluribus. 
-- That pseudo code can be found here, pg. 16: 
---- https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2019/07/10/science.aay2400.DC1/aay2400-Brown-SM.pdf 

Additionally, this code has been applied to Kuhn poker and left in a functional style that mimics code that has been 
pushed to the feature/add-kuhn-poker branch. That code was inspired by the two links below, I believe, pg 12:
-- http://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2013/cfr/cfr.pdf
-- https://github.com/geohot/ai-notebooks/blob/8bdd5ca2d9560f978ea79bb9d0cb8d5acf3dee4b/cfr_kuhn_poker.ipynb

The following code-style choice was made in order to make converting the findings to an OOP style easier and more consistent by
working from a familiar style (meaning, similar variable names, etc.. to the notebook link above), 
while not introducing (more) bugs in a pre-mature conversion to work in our Pluribus framework.

The differences between the following code and the notebook above includes: 
-- Addition of linear CFR
-- Addition of negative regret pruning
-- A method of estimating reach that is based on counting occurrences rather than carrying around PI for each player 
    (PI is the probability of reaching an h)
-- Only updating the strategy every x iterations
-- Based on these changes the algo converges to stratigies for actions, when at nash equilibrium, is at 100% much quicker
    than the previous algorithm, seemingly

The following would still need to be done:
-- Stop using global variables where possible - a lot of potential for subtle bugs
-- Convert to OOP and use the Pluribus game engine
-- Use minutes instead of iterations for the prune_threshold and discount interval
-- Introduce the chance sampling within the algorithm (Kuhn poker can allow for chance to occur before CFR is called,
    where as, No Limit Hold'Em would have chance events that could be reached)
-- Ensure that the algorithm is correct and can be used for No Limit Hold'Em poker
-- Only apply this to the first betting round for Pluribus' blue print strategy
-- Only apply pruning to non-terminal nodes and non-last round of betting as described in the supplementary materials:
---- https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2019/07/10/science.aay2400.DC1/aay2400-Brown-SM.pdf (pg.14 - 15)
-- Only store the actions as you go (not all will be reached in the blue print strategy creation)

Next Steps:
-- Apply this to a short deck no limit hhold em game in conjuction with the clustering algorithm I mocked up found here:
---- https://github.com/fedden/pluribus-poker-AI/blob/develop/research/clustering/information_abstraction.py
-- Mock up the search algorithm found in the supllemental materials

A note on the blue print strategy: I think there can be some confusion (at least for me) on the blue print strategy.
My current understanding is that the each player (p_i) in the set of players (P) occupies a FIXED position in game play. I_i represents a
set of infosets partitioned from I (set of infosets) that is partitioned to which i (player) it belongs. That player is
defined by what order they go in. You can think of that player as being the expert of their position. They all contribute to the
same blue print strategy (sigma) and normalized blue print startegy (phi). The term sigma_i refers to the strategy that is
contributed to by player i based on the I_i, or infosets that they are responsible for in their position. In any case,
only one strategy profile is updated.

That's my understanding anyway. Here is a good link to that effect (this is referenced from the Pluribus paper with regard to 
MCCFR), pg 2, bullet 5 (THIS IS MUCH CLEARER IN THE ACTUAL PAPER IN LINK BELOW):
" For each player i ∈ N a partition Ii of {h ∈ H : P(h) = i} with the property that
A(h) = A(h') whenever h and h' are in the same member of the partition. For Ii ∈ Ii** 
we denote by A(Ii) the set A(h) and by P(Ii) the player P(h) for any h ∈ Ii
. Ii**(is the information partition of player i; a set Ii ∈ Ii** is an information set of player i."
**(this one is the set of all infosets for partition i)
